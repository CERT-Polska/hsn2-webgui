Upgrade contains:
- scheduling mechanism now supports two types of scheduling: 'cron-like' scheduling and a 'run once' scheduling
- added 'origin' column to table of job urls
- added simple job filter
- bugfix: edit of starttime of job is ignored
- added Couchdb cleanup script  

New scheduling mechanism demands some database changes and two additional python packages.
These changes are only needed when UPGRADING the hsn2-webgui!

install python packages:
pip install APScheduler
pip install croniter

update database by running UPGRADE_05092013.sql in MySQL.
Example:
mysql -u hsn2 -p -h localhost hsn2 < UPGRADE_05092013.sql

Synchornize CouchDB views:
Example:
python /srv/www/hsn2/etc/couchdb_views/couchdb_views.py -s
